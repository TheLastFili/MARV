# MARV-
MARV is a tool for students in German comprehensive schools to calculate their possible degrees.

Short for Maschinendialog f√ºr Abschluss-Relevante Voraussetzungen (Machine Dialogue for Degree-Relevant Prerequisites), it opens a terminal and guides the student towards their answer using a series of Yes or No questions.
